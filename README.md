# OSS-Lab-Assignment-2

1. Create a C program that reads a matrix of integers from the user, calculates the transpose of the matrix, and prints
the result. Initialize a new Git repository for this project, commit the code, and upload it to your GitHub account.
Provide the URL of the repository.

2. Write a C program that takes a paragraph input from the user, counts the frequency of each word in the paragraph,
and prints the frequencies. Initialize a Git repository, commit your changes, and push the repository to GitHub.
Share the repository link.

3. Find an open-source C project on GitHub that implements a graph algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm).
Download the project, analyze its code structure, and document how each function works. Initialize a new Git
repository, commit your documentation, and upload it to your GitHub account. Provide the URL of the repository.
